#' Calculate Meal Metrics
#'
#' @description
#' The function meal_metrics calculates three simple glucose meal metrics
#'
#' @usage meal_metrics(data, mealtimes, before_win = 1, after_win = 3,
#' recovery_win = 1, interpolate = FALSE, adjust_mealtimes = FALSE, dt0 = NULL,
#' inter_gap = 45, tz = "")
#'
#' @inheritParams CGMS2DayByDay
#'
#' @param mealtimes Either a vector of mealtimes, corresponding
#' to data being from a single subject, OR a dataframe with at least 2 columns labeled
#' id and mealtime. Optionally the mealtimes dataframe can include a column labeled meal,
#' giving the meal type (helps to compensate for overlapping meals)
#' @param before_win integer specifying number of hours to extend window before meal
#' @param after_win integer specifying number of hours to extend window after meal
#' @param recovery_win interger specifying number of hours for recovery beyond after window
#' @param interpolate Boolean to indicate if CGM data should be interpolated or not.
#' Default set to FALSE due to time intensive nature of interpolation. Parameters dt0,
#' inter_gap, and tz will only be used if interpolate is set to TRUE.
#' @param adjust_mealtimes Boolean to indicate if function should attempt to align
#' mealtimes with CGM data times. This is important if mealtimes and CGM data times
#' are not exactly aligned, because the function will return NA's for mealtimes
#' that don't match with a corresponding CGM time stamp.
#'
#' @return A tibble object with 6 columns will be returned: id, time, meal, deltag,
#' deltat, and basereco.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @details A tibble object is returned with three metrics calculated for each mealtime.
#' The last three columns of the output correspond to the three metrics: deltag
#' refers to \eqn{\Delta G}, deltat is \eqn{\Delta T}, and basereco is \% Baseline recovery.
#' If no meal column is given in the original data, one will be automatically generated
#' with a unique number for each meal.
