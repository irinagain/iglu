<p>Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions (MAGE) is a glucose variability
metric that can be applied to CGM data. From iglu version 3 onward, the
package includes two algorithms for MAGE calculation: (i) version = ‘ma’
uses short and long moving averages to computationally emulate the
original definition, (ii) version = ‘naive’ is a naive approximation
<strong>solely included</strong> for backwards compatibility with
earlier versions of iglu. The moving average algorithm was published in
the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211061165" class="external-link">Open-source Algorithm
to Calculate Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions Using Short and Long
Moving Averages</a>, and the code to reproduce all tests can be found at
the accompanying repository: <a href="https://github.com/Nathaniel-Fernandes/mage_algorithm_data" class="external-link">Nathaniel-Fernandes/mage_algorithm_data</a>.
Below is a supplementary vignette describing the algorithm in more
detail, our design choices, and the methods we used to test it. Some
example code to get started using MAGE in iglu is included in the <a href="#example_code"><em>Implementation</em></a> section.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#abstract"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Glucose variability is increasingly
regarded as a risk factor for diabetes-related complications. The mean
amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) is a common measure of glucose
variability. While its original definition requires manual calculations,
there exist several software programs for automated calculations which
have shown varying degrees of agreement. The objective of this study was
to develop an automated algorithm for MAGE that would achieve high
accuracy against the reference standard of manual calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: Manual calculations of MAGE were performed
on 45 publicly available CGM profiles from a diverse set of patients
(i.e., Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes)
following the definition described in Service et al. [3]. An automated
algorithm for MAGE calculation was developed to identify peaks and
nadirs of glycemic excursions based on the crosses of a short and long
moving average of the glucose profile, and implemented in version 3 of R
package iglu. The accuracy of the algorithm was evaluated relative to
manual calculations using a five-fold cross-validation and compared to
four other publicly available MAGE calculators.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: The newly developed algorithm had the
median error of 1.4% relative to manual calculations (iglu v3.5.1+). The
median errors of the four other approaches including cgmanalysis,
cgmquantify, EasyGV and the naive algorithm in the earlier versions of
iglu were 20.3%, 78.4%, 11.3%, and 42.0%, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The newly developed algorithm
eliminates the need for tedious manual MAGE calculations and
approximates the manual derivation better than existing approaches.</p>

</h2>
<p>Glucose variability is increasingly regarded as a risk factor for
diabetes-related complications beyond HbA1c [1, 2]. The mean amplitude
of glycemic excursions (MAGE) is a commonly used measure of glucose
variability. As defined by Service et al. [3], MAGE is the arithmetic
mean of the amplitude (i.e. height) of glucose excursions that are
greater than the standard deviation of the glucose values. MAGE is
calculated manually by visually inspecting the glucose profiles.
However, this manual approach to calculating MAGE is error-prone and
impractical for large data sets of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
Thus, an automated algorithm for MAGE calculation that approximates the
manual reference is needed.</p>
<p>Several software programs for automated MAGE calculations have been
developed, and these implementations can be divided into two categories:
those that only return the numeric MAGE values, and those that
additionally provide a visual display of the calculations [4]. Examples
in the first category include the Excel®-based workbook EasyGV [5],
online GlyCulator2 [6], R package cgmanalysis [7], early versions of R
package iglu [8], and Python package cgmquantify [9]. Because these
software programs do not output a visual display of the performed
calculations, the user has no means to inspect the calculations and
confirm accuracy. Examples in the second category include programs
developed by Fritzsche [10] and Baghurst [11]. However, we found the
software developed by Fritzsche are not compatible with newer operating
systems (e.g., Windows 10) to allow importing of CGM data. According to
documentation for cgmanalysis [7] and cgmquantify [9], these packages
provide free implementations of Baghurst’s algorithm, albeit they may
not fully reflect the original implementation.</p>
<p>The comparison of GlyCulator, EasyGV, Fritzsche, and Baghurst
algorithms demonstrates varying degrees of agreement across MAGE
algorithms [12]. While the aforementioned algorithms were compared to
each other, they were not compared with the manual reference
standard.</p>
<p>Thus, the objective of current study is to establish an approach of
calculating MAGE that is user-friendly and approximates well the results
obtained manually. Therefore, these goals are defined as follows.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To computationally emulate the manual method in Service et
al. [3] with high accuracy based on the automated detection of peaks and
nadirs tailored specifically towards CGM data</p></li>
<li><p>To provide a freely-available implementation with a visual
display</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To evaluate accuracy, the newly developed algorithm was compared with
the manual derivations along with the other computational
approaches.</p>

<p><em>CGM Data and Manual MAGE Calculation</em></p>
<p>Publicly-available CGM data were obtained from [13], from which 45
CGM traces were selected to represent a diverse set of patients (Type 1
diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes), see Table 1.
Each CGM trace corresponds to one day of measurements (24 h), where a
day is defined from midnight to midnight as it is customary to calculate
MAGE daily. Manual MAGE calculations were performed on each of the 45
CGM traces following the original description of MAGE calculations by
Service et al. [3] by two of the authors, who were unaware of the
outcome of the proposed algorithm’s outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Summary of the 45 CGM traces used for
manual calculations. The first three datasets have been obtained as
described in [13]. The last dataset is available within R package iglu
[8].</p>
<p>   </p>
<p><em>The Algorithm</em></p>
<p>The original MAGE description in Service et al. [3] requires (i)
identification of turning points (e.g., peaks and nadirs) for
calculation of glucose excursions; (ii) filtering those turning points
to only keep relevant glucose excursions and calculating the mean of
those excursion amplitudes (i.e., heights).</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, our implementations for both parts (i)
and (ii) are unique.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>
<p><strong>Identification of peaks and nadirs.</strong> The proposed
algorithm uses the crosses of a short and long moving average to
identify time intervals where a peak or nadir may exist. Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> be the window size for the short
moving average and 𝛽 be the window size for the long moving average,
such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt; \beta\)</span>. Since
the shorter moving average is more affected by local variation in the
glucose values than the longer moving average, a peak or nadir (i.e., a
turning point, <span class="math inline">\({tp}_i\)</span>) must exist
on the intervals that are bounded by the crosses of the two moving
averages <span class="math inline">\(cp_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(cp_{i+1}\)</span> as demonstrated in Figure 1,
with the exception of “whiplash”. (Note: the first and last glucose
values are always treated as crossing points [Appendix: <a href="#why-are-the-first-and-last-data-points-always-treated-as-crossing-points">Why
are the first and last data points always treated as crossing
points?</a>].) To solve the issue of “whiplash”, where the true
peak/nadir falls outside the interval bounded by <span class="math inline">\(cp_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(cp_{i+1}\)</span> for back-to-back sinusoidal
excursions [Appendix: <a href="#what-is-whiplash">What is
whiplash?</a>], we make the assumption that peaks and nadirs alternate
(peak, nadir, peak, nadir, etc.) or vice versa and calculate subsequent
peaks or nadirs sequentially as the maximum or minimum glucose value,
respectively, between the index of <span class="math inline">\(tp_{i-1}\)</span> (left boundary, exclusive) and
<span class="math inline">\(cp_{i+1}\)</span> (right boundary,
inclusive) for <span class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>. The left
boundary is <span class="math inline">\(cp_{i}\)</span> for the base
case of <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A distinct advantage of using moving averages to identify the turning
points is that they inherently smooth out local fluctuations and noise
within larger trends in a glucose profile. The amount of smoothing can
be tuned by varying window size parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. By default, the algorithm uses
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 32\)</span> as these values maximized the
algorithm’s accuracy on the manual MAGE calculations, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in [1, 7]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in [16, 38]\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eliminating Excursions and Calculation of Mean
Amplitudes.</strong> An excursion is defined by three turning points
<span class="math inline">\(E_{i,j,k}=(tp_i, tp_j, tp_k) \text{ s.t. } i
&lt; j &lt; k\)</span> , where the amplitude of the excursion is
calculated as follows: <span class="math inline">\(a(j, i) = |tp_j -
tp_i|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|E_{i,j,k}| =
(|E_{left}|,|E_{right}|)=(a(j, i), a(k, j))\)</span>. An “acceptable”
excursion, as defined by Service et al. [3], requires the amplitudes of
both the left-side and right-side half-excursions to exceed the standard
deviation of the entire CGM trace. Computationally, we devised the
procedure below to calculate acceptable excursions, given a set of
alternating turning points. To prevent double counting excursions, only
ascending (MAGE+) or descending (MAGE–) half-excursion amplitudes are
averaged (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(|E_{left}|\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|E_{right}|\)</span>, respectively), where
ascending means <span class="math inline">\(tp_j\)</span> is a peak and
vice versa. When excursions are symmetric, MAGE+ = MAGE–, however in
general they may disagree [11]. By default, our implementation follows
the description in Service et al. [3], and returns MAGE+ or MAGE–
depending on which type of excursion first crosses the one SD threshold;
however, the user can specify either if desired.</p>
<p><em>Procedure:</em> Starting from <span class="math inline">\(i=1,
j=2\)</span> (note: R is 1-based), check whether the amplitude exceeds
the one standard deviation threshold, <span class="math inline">\(a(j,
i) = a(2, 1) &gt; sd\)</span>. If false, the algorithm will calculate
<span class="math inline">\(\max\; \{a(3,1), \; a(3,2)\} &gt;
sd\)</span> and so on until a large enough amplitude is found or the CGM
trace ends. Note: we use the maximum to enable “accumulation”, an
optimization that allows an earlier larger half-excursion to absorb a
later smaller half-excursion. Once an acceptable left-side
half-excursion is found, the boundaries <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are recorded and the same procedure is
used to find an acceptable right-side excursion, where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is updated if <span class="math inline">\(a(k, i) &gt;= a(j, i)\)</span>. We record <span class="math inline">\(E_{left}\)</span> once <span class="math inline">\(E_{right} &gt; sd\)</span> or the CGM trace
ends.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Handling Gaps</em></p>
<p>The algorithm outlined above assumes that the input CGM trace should
be treated contiguously, with MAGE calculated over the entire trace and
turning points alternate (peak, nadir, peak, nadir, etc.) or vice versa.
However, this can lead to suboptimal results if large gaps are present
in the trace. While small gaps can be interpolated before MAGE
calculation (starting in iglu v3.3.0), CGM values separated by large
gaps should be treated as separate segments, with MAGE calculated on
each segment independently. By default, MAGE released in iglu v3.5.1+
segments the CGM trace by gaps larger than <span class="math inline">\(max\_gap=180 \text{ minutes}\)</span> and
calculates MAGE via the above algorithm on each segment [Appendix: [Why
set a default of 180 minutes for max_gap?]]. The user can then return
the MAGE values for each segment (<span class="math inline">\(MAGE_i\)</span>) or a one-number summary for the
variability of the entire CGM trace (<span class="math inline">\(MAGE_{overall}\)</span>). MAGE for the entire
trace is reported as an average of the segment MAGE values, weighted by
segment length (<span class="math inline">\(MAGE_{overall} = \Sigma
\frac{n_i}{N}MAGE_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> is the length of segment <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N =
\Sigma n_i\)</span>). The plot displays segments with a solid, black
vertical line for the left-boundary and a dashed, black vertical line
for the right boundary.</p>
<p><a name="example_code"></a><br><em>Implementation</em><br>
The newly developed algorithm for MAGE calculation can be found from
version 3 onward in R package iglu [17] as well as the accompanying GUI
via Shiny App [8] - both are free and open-source. Implementation in a
script-based programming language like R allows the creation of
reproducible scripts for all data processing and MAGE calculation steps,
and the availability of a point-and-click GUI meets the needs of
researchers with limited programming experience. By default, the
algorithm uses <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 32\)</span>, however these choices can be
adjusted by the user.</p>

<p><em>Assessment of Accuracy</em><br>
The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was evaluated against 45 manual
calculations. For each CGM trace, the accuracy was measured as the
relative percent difference in the automatically calculated MAGE value
and the manual MAGE value, that is: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{|MAGE_{algorithm} -
MAGE_{manual}|}{MAGE_{manual}}\cdot 100\%\)</span> .</p>
<p>To find optimal combination of window sizes, we considered <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in [1, 7]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in [16, 38]\)</span>, and recorded the mean
errors across 45 CGM traces for each pair of (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>) values. The optimal (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>) pair was determined as the
one that leads to the minimal in-sample error. Since the obtained
minimal error is a biased assessment of accuracy as the optimal (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>) were selected based on the
same 45 traces, five-fold cross-validation was also performed to gain an
unbiased assessment of accuracy. The 45 CGM traces were randomly split
into five groups of nine samples each. The best (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>) combination was then
chosen using four out of the five groups, and used to evaluate the
accuracy on the remaining group. The best combination was defined as the
one that gave the lowest percent error compared to manual calculations.
This out-of-sample evaluation was performed on all five groups.</p>
<p>The accuracy of EasyGV [5], cgmanalysis [7], cgmquantify [9], and the
MAGE algorithm implemented in the earlier version of iglu [8] was also
determined against the manual reference derivation. The latter is a
naive simplification of original MAGE definition, as it calculates MAGE
as the mean of absolute differences between glucose values and the
glucose mean that are larger than one standard deviations (and thus does
not attempt to explicitly identify peaks and nadirs). We use iglu_ma to
denote the proposed algorithm based on moving averages, and iglu_naive
to denote the naive algorithm used in earlier versions of the software.
We were unable to evaluate GlyCulator2 [6] because the software requires
CGM trace to have at least 576 time points, and thus returns NA when
applied to 24-hour CGM data. We were also unable to evaluate Fritzsche
[10] as importing the CGM data into the provided user interface on
Windows 10 lead to errors.</p>

</h2>
<p>The optimal choice of window sizes (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>) for the proposed algorithm
was determined to be (5, 32) as this combination minimized the average
error relative to 45 manual calculations. Figure 3 shows a heatmap of
the percent average error (across 45 traces) as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, where the darkest regions
represent the most favorable combinations of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. (Note: while there was a tie, we
chose hyperparameters in the middle of the dark region.) The minimum
corresponds to a mean average error of 8.9% with a much smaller median
percent error of 1.4% and [Q1, Q3] = [0.5%, 7.1%]. As expected, the
unbiased out-of-sample cross-validated errors are slightly larger, but
still relatively low: 9.1% mean with the median of 10.0% and
inter-quartile range of [9.4%, 11.8%].</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussion"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are several software programs for automatic MAGE calculation,
however, they show varying agreement [12]. In the current study, a new
automated algorithm for MAGE was developed based on moving averages
which demonstrated the least amount of error relative to manual
reference when compared to other automated algorithms.</p>
<p>The newly developed algorithm approximated the manual results better
than EasyGV, cgmanalysis, iglu_naive, and cgmquantify. The largest
discrepancy was noted for cgmanalysis and cgmquantify both of which
implemented Baghurst’s algorithm [11]. It is unclear whether the
deviation from manual reference is due to the underlying algorithm or
the specific of implementations of the algorithm. The differences in
accuracy among the MAGE algorithms points to the necessity of a visual
display of the underlying calculations with identified peaks and nadirs.
While such visual display is implemented for the proposed MAGE algorithm
in version 3 of R package iglu [17], this functionality is absent from
EasyGV, cgmanalysis, and cgmquantify, making it more difficult for the
user to verify the accuracy.</p>
<p>A major challenge for any automated MAGE algorithm is separation of
true peaks and nadirs in a larger trend from the smaller glucose
fluctuations. A particular advantage of the proposed algorithm is the
use of moving averages which inherently smooth out local fluctuations
within a larger trend. The amount of smoothing can be tuned by varying
the window sizes of the short and long moving averages, and we found
that the algorithm is quite robust to the choice of window sizes, with
high accuracy in a large range (Figure 3). One disadvantage is that the
moving average is a lagging indicator, and thus is undefined in the
beginning of the time period (e.g., a moving average of window size 20
is undefined for the first 19 time points). This could skew the
calculations of MAGE if the first times points contain a lot of
variation in subject’s glucose levels. To adjust for this, the algorithm
replaces the undefined moving average values at the first time points
with the first calculated moving average value (e.g., a moving average
of window size 20 will be first calculated at 20th time point, and that
same value will be assigned to the first 19 time point to be later used
in determining the crosses of short and long moving averages). This
adjustment can be seen for the long moving average in Figure 1, where
its value is flat for the first 32 points. Given the high accuracy of
the proposed algorithm compared to manual calculations, this adjustment
is adequate, however it is possible that it may not be adequate for some
CGM profiles. In practice, we recommend to inspect the visual display of
MAGE calculations provided by iglu [17] as in Figures 1 and 2 for
additional accuracy validation. Another challenge for MAGE calculations
is the presence of asymmetric excursions. To prevent double counting,
typically only ascending (MAGE+) or descending (MAGE–) excursion
amplitudes are averaged. When excursions are symmetric, MAGE+ = MAGE–,
and the accuracy is not affected irrespective of the choice of
direction. However, when excursions are asymmetric, the direction
matters as the two disagree. By default, our algorithm follows the
description in Service et al. [3], and calculates MAGE+ or MAGE–
depending on which type of excursion first crosses the one SD threshold.
The same decision is made in [12]. However, Baghurst [11] argues that it
is more appropriate to use <span class="math inline">\(MAGE_{avg} =
\frac{1}{2}(MAGE_{plus}+MAGE_{minus})\)</span>. Our implementation
allows the user to change the default settings, and explicitly calculate
MAGE+, MAGE–, MAGEavg, or MAGEmax, which makes our algorithm’s
implementation more flexible compared to existing MAGE software.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>We pressent a new algorithm for MAGE calculation that significantly
outperforms existing algorithms. The implementation of this algorithm is
free and open-source, it is available in the R package iglu version 3
[17] as well as in the accompanying GUI via Shiny App at <a href="https://irinagain.shinyapps.io/shiny_iglu/" class="external-link uri">https://irinagain.shinyapps.io/shiny_iglu/</a>. Furthermore,
the visual displays of the CGM traces, exact values for manual MAGE and
the code to reproduce all analyses, along with instructions on how to
download each CGM trace, are publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/Nathaniel-Fernandes/mage_algorithm_data" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/Nathaniel-Fernandes/mage_algorithm_data</a>.
The public nature of CGM traces, manual MAGE values, and the algorithm
allow additional validation of presented results by a community at
large.</p>

</h5>
<p>If we didn’t, we would throw away at the beginning or end of CGM
trace because the MAGE algorithm calculates MAGE between the first and
last crossing point. For example, assume a CGM trace of 100 values with
the first and last crossing point at index 20 and 80, respectively. The
turning points are looked for between index 20 and 80, which throws out
the beginning and end. Thus, we automatically record the first and last
points in the CGM trace as crossing points.</p>

<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="what-is-whiplash">What is whiplash?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-whiplash"></a>
</h5>
<p>We coined the term whiplash to describe two back-to-back excursions
that roughly form a sinusoid. These sinusoidal excursions pose a problem
for identifying the true peaks and nadirs defining an excursion since
the moving average is a lagging indicator. In other words, at the end of
one period of a sinusoidal excursion, the long moving average will be
approximately equal to the short moving average (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(MA_{long}(\vec x)\approx MA_{short}(\vec x)\approx
\bar x\)</span>). Since the moving average is a lagging indicator, by
the time a cross between the short and long moving average occurs, the
true peak or nadir indicating the start of an excursion may have already
occurred. Thus, starting in MAGE iglu v3.5.1, we calculate turning
points sequentially between <span class="math inline">\(tp_{i-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(cp_{i+1}\)</span> as compared to <span class="math inline">\(cp_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(cp_{i+1}\)</span>, previously. See the difference
in the identified <span class="math inline">\(tp_{12}\)</span> in the
images below, the first being MAGE iglu v3.5.1 (whiplash corrected) and
the second MAGE iglu v3.5.0 (whiplash not corrected).</p>

</h5>
<p>The purpose of <code>max_gap</code> is to split the CGM trace into
different logical segments - i.e., there are so many missing values
between segments 1 and 2 that it makes more sense to treat them as
separate than as one continuous trace. For example, say a patient wears
their CGM on Monday and Wednesday but forgets on Tuesday. There would be
a stretch of 24-h of missing data! Thus, it makes more sense to
calculate MAGE on Monday and Wednesday independently, as we cannot
extrapolate what occurred in the time in-between.</p>
<p>While it is fairly obvious in the above example that we should
segment the CGM trace, what about shorter stretches of missing data?
Since the purpose of MAGE is to calculate the mean amplitude of glycemic
<em>excursions</em>, the ideal <code>max_gap</code> will split the trace
when there is a possibility of missing an excursion. Since post-prandial
excursions typically last a maximum of 180 minutes [citation needed], we
chose 180 minutes as an acceptable default threshold. To explain in
natural language: if we have &gt;180 minutes of missing data, we likely
have missed either an entire excursion or multiple excursions, so we
treat the trace as two distinct segments.</p>
